# LESampleData
This project aims to provide a range of sample data sets that may be used in applications that focus on the LE domain.
Information is sourced excllusively from public sources. For example, the Person file is based on popular names in the 1990 US Census.
The use of random combinations in this way does not guarantee that a real person's name and perhaps even date of birth will not appear.
It does guarantee that any such resemblances are purely coincidental.
